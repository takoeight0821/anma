_
ÂêçÂâç
```

### Reserved words

```haskell
type
def
infix
infixl
infixr
fn
case
```

## Operators

Operators can be made up of unicode symbols or punctuation characters.

```haskell

<>
>==
üìõ
```

### Reserved operators

## Literals

### Numeric literals

```haskell

0x123
0o123
0b101
123.456
```

### Rune literals

```haskell
'a'
'„ÅÇ'
'\n'
'\x0a'
'\u{1f4a9}'
```

### String literals

```haskell
"Hello, world!"
`some "random" string`
``raw `string` literal``
```

### BNF

```bnf
program = statement* ;

statement = typeDecl | varDecl | infixDecl ;

typeDecl = "type" identifier "=" type ;

varDecl = "def" identifier "=" expression | "def" identifier ":" type "=" expression | "def" identifier ":" type ;

infixDecl = "infix" operator int | "infixl" operator int | "infixr" operator int ;

type = <subset of expression> ;

expression
    = identifier
    | literal
    | "(" expression ")"
    | expression "." identifier
    | expression "(" ")"
    | expression "(" expression ("," expression)* ","? ")"
    | expression operator expression
    | expression ":" type
    | "let" pattern "=" expression
    | codata
    | lambda
    | case
    | object ;

codata = "{" clause ("," clause)* ","? "}" ;

lambda = "fn" pattern "{" expression (";" expression)* ";"? "}" ;

case = "case" expression "{" clause ("," clause)* ","? "}" ;

object = "{" field ("," field)* ","? "}" ;

field = identifier ":" expression (";" expression)* ";"? ;

clause = pattern "->" expression (";" expression)* ";"? ;

pattern = <subset of expression> | "#" ;
